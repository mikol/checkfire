            <h2>Wildfire Detection and Checking</h2>
            <p>
                Wildfires are getting more destructive over time due to many factors including climate change.
                Besides the devastating impact on lives and property, wildfires also release significant amount
                of carbon back into the atmosphere, thus speeding up climate change even further.
                Depending on the location situation, sometimes it is better in the long-term to let fires burn,
                while at other times it's better to extinguish the fires as soon as possible.
                This project does not have any opinion on determining the optimal action for each fire.
                The goal of this project is to automatically detect wildfires in their initial phase,
                so the authorities responsible for wildfires can take appropriate action while the fire is
                still small and easy to manage.
            </p>
            <p>
                This project uses machine learning to identify potential smoke from wildfires using real-time images
                from images installed on vantage points, such as mountain tops. The information about the potential
                wildfires are then sent to website for people to check and confirm whether they are real fires.
                This system has successfully detected some fires before authorities were aware of them,
                but the system also generates some false notificatons.  Therefore, it is useful to
                have people review the notificatons.  This system monitors more than a hundred cameras
                continuously, and usually generates less than 50 notifications a day.
                Doing the same task without such a system would require a large group of people to continuously
                stare at real-time images coming from a hundred cameras and maintain high vigilence throughout.
                That is the main impediment why these cameras are currently not used for detection, but only
                for verifying reports and for monitoring known fires.
            </p>
            <p>
                Folks from multiple organizations have contributed to this project during its lifetime -
                listing some of them here in alphabetical order:

                <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Wildfire Detection</h3>
                The detection technique used by this project relies on machine learning based system.
                We trained a machine learning model for image object recognitionon (Inception V3) on cropped images of
                smoke from early phases of historical fires. Real-time images are collected from
                <a href="https://hpwren.ucsd.edu/">HPWREN cameras</a>, divided into slightly overlapping squares of
                299x299 pixels, and the machine learning system computes a value (between 0.0 and 1.0) for each square.
                High values are more likely to be real wildfires. The system is not perfect and regularly generates
                false positives, which are mostly triggered by fog or clouds. We are continuously working on improving
                the accuracy of the system. Below are sample images of both true and false positives.
                <div class="w3-row-padding">
                    <div class="w3-col l6 m6 w3-margin-bottom">
                        <div class="w3-display-container">
                            <div class="w3-display-topleft w3-black w3-padding">True Positive</div>
                            <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/oct-fire-public/website/true-pos800.jpg"

                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="w3-col l6 m6 w3-margin-bottom">
                        <div class="w3-display-container">
                            <div class="w3-display-topleft w3-black w3-padding">False Positive</div>
                            <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/oct-fire-public/website/false-pos800.jpg"
                                alt="True Positive Smoke" style="width:100%">
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                When one of the squares scores high, the detection system applies a few other checks to
                discard cases that are unlikely to be smoke from real fires.
                A detailed description of an earlier version of the system and how it performed during a pilot period
                in Oct 2019 are published in this
                <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/rs12010166">paper</a>
                published in peer reviewed Remote Sensing journal.

                Also, the <a href="https://github.com/open-climate-tech/firecam">source code</a>
                for the detection system is available on Github.

                <h3 class="w3-padding-16">Wildfire Checking</h3>
                The real-time potential fire notifications from the detection service are displayed on
                <a href="/wildfirecheck/">this live updating site</a>.

                In case someone discovers a real fire that recently ignited, they should consider informing the wildfire
                dispatch center to take appropriate action.  Please note that this site does not alert the authorities directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The site also allows users to vote on each notificaton to indicate whether it was a real fire or not.
                The events where the majority of the users confirm a real fire are displayed on a separate
                <a href="/confirmed/">Confirmed Fires</a> tab.
                The votes are also helpful for improving the system by retraining the machine learning system with new images.
                Users can also specify a desired geographical region to limit the notifications to those that may
                overlap the specified region.

                The <a href="https://github.com/open-climate-tech/checkfire">source code</a> for the wildfire checking
                website is available is available on Github.

                Open Climate Tech, Inc. is a non-profit organization that was formally founded in 2020.

                Although technology alone can't fix all the problems made worse by climate change, we believe
                technology can help mitigate some of the adverse effects.

                The projects supported by this organization are developed by volunteers, and we welcome enthusiastic
                contributors interested in joining existing projects or starting new projects.

                We believe that open sourcing the technology helps collaboration with other groups and encourages
                volunteers.  All code should have an open source license.
